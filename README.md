# MetaReader

MetaReader is a tool to read the contents of snapshot (.snp) and failoverlog 
(.fol) files generated by Couchbase enterprise backup tool 'cbbackupmgr'.

The only dependency is cbflag which can be install using

```
go get github.com/couchbase/cbflag
```

## Usage
To dump the contents of the snapshot file for all vBuckets use the snapshot 
command

```
metareader snapshot -p /repo/archive/2019-01-25T10_03_15.064487Z/beer-sample-1da173e4511d0bfa50e47c146dfe340a/data 
```

To dump the contents of the failoverlog file for all vBuckets use the snapshot
command
```
metareader failoverlog -p /repo/archive/2019-01-25T10_03_15.064487Z/beer-sample-1da173e4511d0bfa50e47c146dfe340a/data 
```

You can filter vBuckets in both commands by using `--filter` which takes a 
comma separated list of vBuckets to display (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5), it also will 
accept ranges (e.g 0-10,30-50), ranges are inclusive.
